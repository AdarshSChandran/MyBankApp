to create http request
    import HttpClientModule
        - class name HttpClient


api request is a asynchronous request, so to solve asynchronous request in TypeScript we use RxJs method (in JS we use promise)
                                                                                                |
                                                                                             observable
        for this method there are two chances - Resolve and Reject
            Resolve - subscribe()            like in JS we use then() method
            Reject  - catch()                like in JS we use catch() method
